					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that choosing an appropriate font can enhance the message of a design. Beyond readability, fonts serve as a medium for setting the mood and tone.
								On the other hand, a bad choice of font can undermine a design by distracting from its purpose.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The part of the article that was most interesting to me was font pairing. While keeping fonts to a minimum is good for simplicity, it is also good to contrast between fonts to differentiate texts.
								This style of layering fonts can create a structure that readers naturally follow as they look at the design.  </p>
