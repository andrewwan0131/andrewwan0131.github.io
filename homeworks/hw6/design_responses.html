					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that good animations have a good balance between fast and slow animation speed. Animation should also depend on the size of the object. Adding acceleration and deceleration makes the movement more natural. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the easing animation. Seeing the difference between ease and not ease really changed how the animation looked. I like how physics principles are helpful with animations. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or deceleration â€” just like all live objects in the physical world.
